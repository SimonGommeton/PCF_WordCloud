## N Gram
This dataset component provides **PowerApps** users with a customisable word cloud that implements **N-gram**.  
N-gram allows users to know the number of occurencies of **_n_** words within a text.

## Parameters
The component is compatible with several **_text_** data types in **CDS**: SingleLine.Text, SingleLine.TextArea and Multiple.  

The number of words generated by the component can be changed as well as the source field directly from PowerApps.  
In what relates to the n-gram length, users can define **_n_** in accordance to their needs.

From index.ts, users may also add words they don't wish for the component to treat to the **stop_words** list.  
In addition, they can modify or add colors to the **colorset** list - by providing the hexadecimal codes of the colors.

### Amcharts
The front-end part of the component uses the following library from Amcharts:   
[Amcharts](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/chart-types/wordcloud/)

Therefore, users can customise even further the word cloud, by modifying the **Configure Series** method from index.ts:  
* Minimum and maximum font size
* Rotation threshold
* Tooltips
