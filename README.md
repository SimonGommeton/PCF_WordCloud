## N Gram / Parameters
This dataset component provides **PowerApps** users with a customisable word cloud that implements **N-gram**.  
N-gram allows users to know the number of occurencies of **_n_** words within a text. Users define **_n_** in accordance to their needs.

The component is compatible with several **_text_** data types in **CDS**: SingleLine.Text, SingleLine.TextArea and Multiple.  
The number of words generated by the component can be changed as well as the source field directly from PowerApps.

From index.ts, users may also add words they don't wish for the component to treat to the **stop_words** list.  
In addition, they can modify or add colors to the **colorset** list - by providing the hexadecimal codes of the colors.

## Amcharts
The front-end part of the component uses the following library from Amcharts:   
[Amcharts](https://www.amcharts.com/docs/v4/chart-types/wordcloud/)

Therefore, users can customise even further the word cloud, by modifying the **Configure Series** method from index.ts:  
* Minimum and maximum font size
* Rotation threshold
* Tooltips
